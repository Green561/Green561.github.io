<h>Devlog 1 - 4/24/25: What is LACERATOR?</h>
<p>First log. First, I should probably explain what LACERATOR is. Lacerator is a classic DOOM-inspired FPS made using the Easy FPS Editor (EFPSE) Engine.
I chose this engine mainly because it requires very little programming knowledge to make stuff with, and I just like how games made with it look.
The engine has its own programming language which the entire syntax of fits within 2 pages. The engine has quite a few limitations, but they don't
matter much for the type of project I'm making.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough about the engine. What actually IS LACERATOR??? Well like I said, LACERATOR (also yes, I am going to spell it all caps. Every time.)
is heavily inspired by the original DOOM games. I absolutely love the original DOOMs. Something about the crustiness, the unique enemies, maze-like levels
and just the genuinely good design made it so fun.</p>
<p>So with LACERATOR, I'm taking my love of DOOM, 3D modeling, and game design to make something that people will hopefully like!
Right now, progress is going relatively smoothly. I've created the first level (it isn't very detailed but it works!) 2 weapons: The Drill and The Revolver.
And 2 enemies: The Paleskin and The Brute.</p>
<img src="PaleskinDev1.png">
<p>The Paleskin is a pretty standard demon. Just shoots projectiles at you. Their backstory is way more interesting than their gameplay, though.
I've had this idea floating around my head for a while about a monster that has it's skeleton on the outside, and guts on the inside. And they have a ton
of holes in them they can dig into so they can grab that flesh and fling it at any unsuspecting bystander. That essentially became the Paleskin. I'm also
gonna use this opportunity to explain how I make the sprites for these nasty creatures. I start off by sculpting a 3D model of the enemy (even the parts
that will literally never be seen) using Blender. I then texture it using Substance 3D Painter. As much as adobe sucks, this is a pretty good product.
After that I reimport the model back into Blender, give it a rig so it can move its arms and legs and all that, then create different poses for things like
attacking, walking, dying, etc.</p>
<img src="BruteDev1.png">
<p>THE BRUTES!!! The Brutes are these big stupid mouthbreathers that run at you and try to bite you. I created them to make Paleskin encounters more interesting.
Since you can easily just sidestep to avoid their projectiles, the brutes force you to run around avoiding them, making predicting Paleskin projectiles harder,
and making aiming harder. Theres basically no story behind them, I just drew it once, thought it looked cool and added it to the game.</p>
<p>I should probably talk about the story of this game now. Its not too complicated. You're playing as a good Christian boy named Mark. Demons invade your city
and start killing everyone, God wants you to stop them! Now grab a Drill and start gutting those demons! Its slightly more in-depth than that but that's basically
what it is.</p>
<p>Now I think you're caught up with all of whats happening. The plan for the future is basically to just finish the first episode. 8 levels and 1 secret, just like DOOM.
I plan on releasing the first episode for free on itch.io or steam or whatever. Then finishing up the last 2 episodes and making that paid. Anyways, thanks for reading
this long! I hope to see you again! Bye!!!</p>

<h>Devlog 2 - 4/25/25: Enemy Ideas</h>
<p>Hello! In this log I'm gonna talk about enemies. Right now the only 2 completed enemies are the Paleskin and the Brute, as I said in the previous log. I realized that
a very important enemy type was missing. Hitscanners! Hitscanners are the backbone of enemy placement in DOOM. They are what is going to do the most damage to you.
Imp fireballs and Pinky bites might hurt, but it's a shotgunner that's gonna get you killed. Now I did have another hitscan enemy concept that I'll talk about later
but I needed some sort of gunner guy, and eventually I came up with...</p>
<img src="CultistDev2.gif">
<p>The Cultist! These are the guys who caused the demon invasion and now they're possessed by demons and want to stop you! I gave them some placeholder sprites I made
in MS paint (these unfortunately will be replaced by the model renders) and they're basically fully functional. They walk up to you, try to shoot you, repeat.
They arent meant to be too complex so yeah.</p>
<img src="IllithidDev2.png">
<p>Now to talk about things that don't exist yet. Enemy ideas!!! First, let's start off with the Illithid. The Illithid is a giant brain flesh thing with a huge eyeball
attached to a stem, with big spikes at the roots. He is a hitscanner enemy that uses his MIND POWERS to psychically damage you. This only works if he has direct line of
sight though. He also cant move so hiding behind a wall is a very good option against him. He's also pretty beefy so combat encounters can wildly change if he's there.</p>
