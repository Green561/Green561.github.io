    <h>History</h>
    <p>Before the year 497, most combat attire worn by military personnel was lightweight, not carrying many utilities or providing much protection. The Panzer Assault Automated Mobility Suit Mk. II was the first suit to incorporate AMS functionality into the design,
    as it was made to provide the same amount of protection as the Panzer Mk. I, while being more suitable for average humans. The first non-personalized and mass-produced AMS was the Hudson Assault Automated Mobility Suit Mk. I, a modified version of the Panzer Mk. II,
    created with inexpensive materials and less utility, alongside being designed for use with rifles and pulse cannons rather than arm-mounted weaponry.</p>
    <h>Function</h>
    <p>The Automated Mobility Suit (AMS) is a motor system installed onto heavy-duty suits that automatically moves the suit's joints and limbs, allowing for ease of movement with suits of any weight and size.</p>
