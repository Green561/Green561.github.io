<h>History</h>
<p>The Federation originated on planet Vulcan and started as a small nation in the modern sector 4. Eventually, they expanded to other celestial bodies in the 400s. Due to their large numbers and powerful weaponry, they were able to liberate other celestial bodies such as Oran and Limos (452 and 432). The federation’s origin planet, Vulcan became a factory moon despite it being a planet. These types of celestial bodies are usually constructed over several centuries to produce different types of equipment. Though, Vulcan was mechanized in only 70 years. It mainly produces weapons and spacecraft. One of the federation's main bases of operation is Carrier-A—a massive spacecraft located in a classified area of the Cyran Nebula. A Carrier-B was under construction but a terrorist attack forced the construction of it to a halt.</p></a>
