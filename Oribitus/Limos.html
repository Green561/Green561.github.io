    <h>History</h>
    <p>Limos was the second planet found in the Oribitus system, and was a large point of interest to early colonizers, due to its large diameter, fetile soil, and lack of natural threats. Eventually, around 601, settlers first landed on Limos. Cities were established and many centuries later, Limos became one of the most populated planets.</p>
    <h>Geography</h>
    <p>Limos is largely a desert planet, it has a diameter of 17,162 km, and has a population of around 14.3 Billion. There are very few natural points of interest on the surface of the planet, however there are many man-made structures such as cities and machines. The biggest city on Limos is Talos, with a population of 4.8 Billion. In the center of the city there is a mechanical anomaly colloquially known as The Drill.</p>
