    <h>History</h>
    <p>Limos was the first planet found in the Oribitus system, and was a large point of interest to early colonizers, due to its large diameter, fertile soil, and lack of natural threats. Eventually, on 8/9/322, settlers first landed on Limos. Cities were established and many centuries later, Limos became one of the most populated planets in the Cyralon Nebula. Limos has an estimated population of 14.3 Billion</p>
    <h>Geography</h>
    <p>Limos is the 2nd planet in the Oribitus system. It is largely a desert planet, it has a diameter of 17,162 km. There are very few natural points of interest on the surface of the planet, however there are many man-made structures such as cities and machines. The biggest city on Limos is Talos, with a population of 1.8 Billion. In the center of the city there is a Mechanica colloquially known as Augerola. The Federation's Mechanica Research Division has classified it as MA-02.</p>
