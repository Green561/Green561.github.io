    <h>Biology</h>
  <p>The Carcass Pitcher is a species of carnivorous plant(?) that originated on the Gymir. The Pitcher reproduced extraordinarily quickly. Thus, They can be found in every region of the planet, except for the mainland. However, they have been seen near the coast of Tiamat. They are most commonly found in Ocean Sector 3. The creature's diet mainly consists of small isopods, luring them in with its rotting smell, tricking the prey into thinking it is a dead animal. The Pitcher has been seen digesting creatures up to 1.78 meters in length, such as Lazaran Reapers. The Pitcher also has several roots that can extend up to 5 meters in length and can sense nearby movement. The Pitcher reproduces using what are presumed to be spores, which it releases in a coughing motion every 3-5 days, however, it can be triggered to release these spores instantaneously if it senses pressure near, or on its roots, usually caused by a creature stepping near it. It does this as a self defense mechanism, as the spores also contain an extremely dangerous toxin that has not been identified by the Federation as of 1271. A vast majority of the spores produced by the creature do not live long enough to become an adult Pitcher. Though, ones that land on hard surfaces such as rocks and metal have been observed to grow naturally. </p>
    <h>Safety</h>
    <p>Being digested by this creature is not a major threat, as it cannot fit the average adult male in its mouth. The main threat that this creature poses is its spores. Going anywhere near it can startle it and cause it to release them. The best option for safety is to either completely avoid the Carcass Pitcher within a 6-meter radius, or if you do somehow startle it, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction of where the spores are going.</p>
