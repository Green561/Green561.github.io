    <h>Biology</h>
  <p>The Carcass Pitcher is a species of carnivorous plant(?) that originated on  <a href="Gymir.html">Gymir</a>. The Pitcher reproduces extraordinarily quickly. Thus, They can be found in nearly every region of the planet, excluding Land Sector 1. However, they have been seen near the coast of Tiamat. They are most commonly found in Ocean Sector 3. The creature's diet mainly consists of small isopods, luring them in with its rotting smell, tricking the prey into thinking it is a dead animal. The Pitcher has been seen digesting creatures up to 1.78 meters in length, such as <a href="Common Lazaran Reaper.html">Lazaran Reapers</a>, Though this is far from a common occurrence The Pitcher also has several roots which can extend up to 5 meters in length and have the capability to sense nearby movement. The Pitcher reproduces using what are presumed to be spores, which it releases in a coughing motion once every 3-5 terrestrial days, however, it can be triggered to release these spores instantaneously if it senses pressure on its roots, typically caused by a creature stepping near it. This is done as self defense mechanism, as the spores contain an extremely dangerous toxin that has not been identified by the Federation as of 1272. A vast majority of the spores produced by the creature do not live long enough to fully mature. This is most likely due to lower pressure of most sectors on Gymir. This is due to the Carcass Pitcher being native to Ocean Sector 3 </p>
    <h>Safety</h>
    <p>Being digested by this creature is not a major threat, as it cannot fit the average adult male in its mouth. The main threat that this creature poses is its spores. Going anywhere near it can trigger its defense mechanism and cause it to release them. The Federation approved safety protocol is to completely avoid the Carcass Pitcher within a 6-meter radius, and if you do somehow startle it, disable your oxygen filtering system and run opposite to the drift of the spores</p>
