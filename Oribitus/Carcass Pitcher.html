    <h>Biology</h>
  <p>The Carcass Pitcher is a species of carnivorous plant native to <a href="Gymir.html">Gymir</a>. The Pitcher reproduces extraordinarily quickly and thus can be found in nearly every region of the planet, excluding Land Sector 1. 
    However, they have been seen near the coast of Tiamat. They are most commonly found in Ocean Sector 3. The creature's diet mainly consists of small arthropods, luring them in with its rotting smell, tricking the prey into thinking it is the carcass of another animal.
    The Pitcher has been seen digesting creatures up to 1.78 meters in length, such as <a href="Lazaran Reaper.html">Lazaran Reapers</a>, though this is far from a common occurrence. 
    The Pitcher also has several roots, which can extend up to 5 meters in length and have the capability to sense nearby movement. 
    The Pitcher reproduces using what are presumed to be spores, which it releases in a coughing motion once every 3-5 days; however, it can be triggered to release these spores instantaneously if it senses pressure on its roots, 
    typically caused by a creature stepping near it. This is done as self self-defense mechanism, as the spores contain some type of hemotoxin. 
    A vast majority of the spores produced by the creature do not live long enough to fully mature. This is most likely due to the lower pressure of most sectors on Gymir and that the Carcass Pitcher is native to Ocean Sector 3.</p>
    <h>Safety</h>
    <p>Being digested by this creature is not a major threat, as it cannot fit the average adult human in its mouth. The primary threat posed by this creature is its spores. 
      Moving near it can trigger its defense mechanism and cause it to release them. The Oribitus-approved safety protocol is to avoid the Carcass Pitcher within a 6-meter radius, 
      and if you do startle it, disable your oxygen filtering system and run opposite to the drift of the spores.</p>
