<h>Biology</h>
<p>This Reaper species seems to have originated near Land Sector 1, though it has migrated to the Lazaran Trench in Ocean Sector 3 and is now considered an invasive species. Due to the depth and pressure of the trench, the Multesca has gained several deformities, as its body in unable to adjust to the environment. The primary difference between the <a href="Common Lazaran Reaper.html">Lazaran Reaper</a> and the Multesca is in its behavior. Rather than being territorial predators, similar to Lazaran Reapers, it prefers to hunt alone and stalk its prey. The Multesca also possesses some differences in biology. Rather than several mandibles meant for tearing flesh, it has 4 that contain a paralyzing neurotoxin, meant to trap prey after it has caught them. Rather than large, razored claws, it has rather weak claws that are usually used for moving objects. Similarly to most apex predators, the Multesca possesses eyes in front of its head, rather than the sides.</p></a>
<h>Safety</h>
<p>Due to the fact that it prefers to stay hidden, noticing when a Multesca is hunting you is challenging. The best course of action is to check if you are in a location where Multescas have been commonly reported, and if you are, stay extremely cautious of your surroundings. Try looking around yourself, and listening to any quiet sounds. Though even then Multescas are extremely good at hiding from you and may be able to catch up on you. If you spot a Multesca, your best course of action is to either run as far as possible from the location, or the much riskier option of attempting to neutralize the threat. An effective tool for both of these options is a Federation Assigned EPG. Multescas can be extremely hostile, so do not enter their territory unless necessary.</p></a>
