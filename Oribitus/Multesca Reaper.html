<h>Biology</h>
<p>The Multesca Reaper is a species of aquatic insectoid native to <a href="Gymir.html">Gymir</a>. appears to have originated near Ocean Sector 1, though it has migrated to the Lazaran Trench in Ocean Sector 3 and is now considered an invasive species. Due to the depth and pressure of the trench, 
  The Multesca has gained several deformities, as its body is unable to adjust to the environment. The primary difference between the <a href="Lazaran Reaper.html">Lazaran Reaper</a> and the Multesca is in its behavior. 
  Rather than being territorial predators, similar to Lazaran Reapers, it prefers to hunt alone and stalk its prey. The Multesca also possesses some differences in biology. Rather than several mandibles meant for tearing flesh, 
  it has 4 that contain a paralyzing neurotoxin, meant to trap prey after it has caught them. Rather than large, razored claws, it has somewhat weak claws that are usually used for moving objects. Similar to most apex predators, 
  the Multesca possesses eyes in front of its head, rather than on the sides.</p></a>
<h>Safety</h>
<p>Because it prefers to stay hidden, noticing when a Multesca is hunting you can be difficult. The best course of action is to check if you are in a location where Multescas have been commonly reported, 
  and if you are, stay extremely cautious of your surroundings. Try looking around yourself and listening to any sudden noises. Though even then, Multescas are extremely good at hiding from you and may be able to catch up to you. 
  If you spot a Multesca, your best course of action is to either relocate to another area or, the more dangerous option, attempt to exterminate it. An effective tool for both of these options is an EPG. 
  Multescas are extremely hostile, so do not enter their territory unless necessary.</p></a>
