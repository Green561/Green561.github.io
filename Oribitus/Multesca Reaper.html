<h>Biology</h>
<p>This Reaper species originated near the Gymirean mainland's coast, though it has migrated to the Lazaran trench and is now considered an invasive species. Due to the depth and pressure of the trench, the Multesca has gained several deformities, as its body is not used to the environment.  The main difference between the common Lazaran reaper and the Multesca is its behavior. Rather than being territorial predators like Lazaran reapers, it prefers to hunt alone and stalk its prey. The Multesca also has very different biology. Instead of several mandibles meant for tearing flesh, it has 4 that contain a paralyzing neurotoxin, meant to trap prey after it has snuck up on them, instead of large, yet microscopically razored claws, it has rather weak claws that are mostly used for simply moving objects. Similarly to most apex predators, the Multesca has eyes in front of its head, rather than the sides.</p></a>
<h>Safety</h>
<p>Due to its sneakiness, noticing when a Multesca is hunting you is challenging. The best course of action is to see if you are in a location where Multescas have been commonly reported, and if you are, become extremely aware of your surroundings by looking around yourself, and listening to smaller sounds such as squealing and clacking. Though even then Multescas are extremely good at hiding from you and will be able to sneak up on you. If you spot a Multesca, your best course of action is to either run as far as possible from the sighting location, or the much riskier option of attempting to neutralize the threat. An effective tool for both of these options is a Federation Assigned Neurotranilizer. Multescas can be extremely hostile and hazardous so do not enter their territory unless necessary.</p></a>
