    <h>History</h>
    <p>Phlogistine (also known as Phlegethon) was the 2nd planet to be discovered in the <a href="Oribitus System.html">Oribitus System</a>. Located in 298 by astronomer Anetru Nupase. Due to its high temperatures and lack of natural resources, it was not a point of interest for Oribitus. 
      However, in the early 500s, several reactors were set up near the planet's surface, transforming it into a semi-factory moon.</p>
