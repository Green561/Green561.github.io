    <h>Biology</h>
    <p>The Sea Hornet is a species of aquatic insectoid native to <a href="Gymir.html">Gymir</a>. It is most commonly found in Ocean Sector 3. It is a nomadic creature that often lives in packs. Its diet mainly consists of small insectoids such as Golantions.</p>
    <h>Safety</h>
    <p>Sea Hornets are not hostile creatures, though they can pose a threat if you do not take the proper precautions. When startled, one may jerk its stinger towards you, possibly puncturing your Gymir Exploration Specialized AMS. The best course of action when
    in an encounter with a Sea Hornet, it is best to ignore it and walk away. Do not make eye contact with it, as though it is rare; they can show aggression to those whom they believe are threatening them.</p>
