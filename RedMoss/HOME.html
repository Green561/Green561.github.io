<h>LOG 1</h>
<p>On October 12th, 2008. A post was made on an unknown image board. It was titled "Edifice". The poster reported an incident relating to a parasitic moss-like phenomena.</p>
<section class="Post">
<h1>Edifice</h1>
<p1>everything I say in this post is real. i know it happened. this is not a joke. i am not trying to scare anyone. i need to tell you the truth.
when I was a kid, everyone around me would talk about these scary stories that they heard about. i knew they weren't real. but I heard about one
that scared me. some kids would talk about a building in the forest that was leaking blood. it was the one from the news. the one where everyone died
from a fire. they said that they walked through the forest to see the building. and it was covered in blood. they said they could show me.
i followed them. they brought me to a part of the forest where you could just barely see the place. it wasn't charred from any sort of fire. 
it was covered in red, chunky blood. when I saw it, my stomach sank. i thought that it was just a story. it was real. i ran. i ran. i ran and I cried and I cried until I got home. 
it haunted me. a few days ago. i got sick of it. i could barely sleep for years and i knew i had to see what was really there. i drove until i got there. during
the drive i felt sick. like i was going to vomit. but i knew i had to see what was really there. maybe i could have seen it wrong. i only looked
for a few seconds. when i arrived. i took my gun out of the glove box and i walked out. the snow almost reached my knees. the forest went so deep. i could only look down. i didn't want
to see it. eventually the trees disappeared. i knew i was there. i looked up. i saw it. it wasn't blood. it was a disgusting red moss crawling
along the building. pulsating. it looked like it could barely breathe. i don't know if it was just my fear. but i could make out faces in the vines
of it. they were screaming and wailing and they wanted nothing more than to hurt me. i started trembling and i could feel that sickness from the car
building up again. it was looking at me. i walked in. this disgusting carpet.</p1>
