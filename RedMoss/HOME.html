<h>Devlog 1 - 4/24/25: What is LACERATOR?</h>
<p>First log. First, I should probably explain what LACERATOR is. Lacerator is a classic DOOM-inspired FPS made using the Easy FPS Editor (EFPSE) Engine.
I chose this engine mainly because it requires very little programming knowledge to make stuff with, and I just like how games made with it look.
The engine has its own programming language which the entire syntax of fits within 2 pages. The engine has quite a few limitations, but they don't
matter much for the type of project I'm making.</p>
<p>Anyways, enough about the engine. What actually IS LACERATOR??? Well like I said, LACERATOR (also yes, I am going to spell it all caps. Every time.)
is heavily inspired by the original DOOM games. I absolutely love the original DOOMs. Something about the crustiness, the unique enemies, maze-like levels
and just the genuinely good design made it so fun.</p>
<p>So with LACERATOR, I'm taking my love of DOOM, 3D modeling, and game design to make something that people will hopefully like!
Right now, progress is going relatively smoothly. I've created the first level (it isn't very detailed but it works!) 2 weapons: The Drill and The Revolver.
And 2 enemies: The Paleskin and The Brute.</p>
